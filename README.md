# Caesar Chiper - Tools

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

This repository will help you to lock messages using the caesar cipher technique, but this repository can also help you to bruteforce messages in the form of caesar chiper code. Use “Decrypt.py” to decrypt your message, otherwise use “Encrypt.py” to lock your message.
